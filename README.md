# Playlist CRUD Application

The playlist app allows users to register and add their favorite songs to the database. Users are then able to add other songs to their playlist. The user page shows which songs have been added to your playlist. An individual songs page shows which users have added the song and how many times. The project was built and deployed to an AWS EC2 server in under 4.5 hours.
